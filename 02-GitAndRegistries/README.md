# Module 2: Revision Control and Artifact Repositories

In the last lab you learned about using APIs with Metapod. 

This module will introduce git and talk about branches, pull requests, etc. 
We will also talk about Docker Registries: Places to store your docker images

# 2.1 Git

_Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed
to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and
efficiency._

Version control systems have been around for years and there is more than just
git.  Git, however has some properties that make it very popular.  Primarily
its the ability to merge and branch changes that make it so effective.  While
you may think its something only used by developers, as we start to think of
"Infrastructure as Code" it makes sense that we maintain iterations of our
infrastructure in a convenient place.  Git provides this for us.  

What else can be stored in git?  All kinds of things!  Presentations, websites, 
resumes, etc. 

# 2.1.1 Sign up for Github

While git is free and opensource, Github is a company that stores github repositories
for you.  You can make as many repositories as you want in Github for free but 
they are publicly available.  So never store sensative things like passwords or 
account information on it.  

If you do not have an account, [sign up for Github now](http://github.com). There
is no cost to sign up for free.
