# Module 3: Continous Integration
[Home](https://github.com/vallard/CiscoCloudDayLab1)

The first two modules got us working with APIs, Git, and Docker.  In this module
we will tie all of it together with some helpful bots.  In this case
our bot will be [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org).  

We're going to create a fun website.  This website will be front-ended with a
load balancer that will then direct traffic to some of our instances.  

When ever we push new code, our robot will take the code out of gitlab run
some tests, and then push the new code into production.  

## 3.1 Configure Gitlab





## 3.2 Configure Jenkins
